Robust control of 8 DOF active vehicle suspension system
Vehicle suspension system plays an important role in maintaining the standard of
ride quality and road handling. Poor ride quality and road handling deteriorates
the ride comfort and vehicle's health. Active suspension system has an active
actuator to add and dissipate energy from the system to give better ride quality
and road handling.
It is usually required to maximize the ride quality for driver. To achieve this,
driver seat dynamics are very important to be considered. Hence an 8 DOF active
suspension full car model is proposed this thesis. Based on this model, many
control schemes for effective disturbance attenuation on seat can be derived.
Controller design for polytopic system involves complex mathematics. To reduce
the complexity, COG representation of polytopic systems is introduced in this
thesis.
Mass of the vehicle is dependent on the passengers and hence it is an uncertain
quantity. Suspension system is required to be robust against such uncertainty.
This thesis deals with the design of a Robust Hinf controller controller which
maintains ride quality in case of road disturbance and uncertain vehicle's mass.
Control input in case of active suspension system is delayed due to electromechanical
nature of the actuator and microprocessors processing time. This
delayed input can deteriorate the performance if controller is not robust against
delay. This thesis deals with the design of such a Robust Hinf controller that is
robust against the input delay.
Suspension system health can deteriorate with the passage of time due to wear and tear of the suspension parts. Active suspension actuator should be robust to
deal with such condition. This thesis deals with the design of a actuator fault
tolerant Robust Hinf controller for full vehicle model.
Robust Hinf controllers for disturbance rejection, parametric uncertainty eect
minimization, delayed input eect minimization and fault tolerance have been
designed in this thesis for active suspension system. Simulation results are
provided to evaluate the effectiveness of design.
